      Your job is to create a great city. A city that attracts citizens from the other cities, that others have created. Citizens are picky â€” some prefer low tax rates (which will leave you with less money), and some prefer higher-levelled jobs (which sill be expensive to develop.)

    <p class="max-w-sm">
      All cities are beholden to pollution. If there's enough pollution, citizens start dying. It's very expensive to remove pollution from the world. However, it's also expensive to build clean power sources.
