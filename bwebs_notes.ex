# society simulator 2021

# TODO:

# make it so if there are no citizens working, buildings aren't operational?

# implement regional differences (check region in generation functions) (done for energy, should do for health & fun)

# add upgrades for different buildables

# figure out why server sometimes doesn't restart


# FIRST RELEASE

# add more upgrades
# balance prices
# reset/migrate prod DB

#done
# get buildings not operating if there's no citizens to work there
  # for each citizen, go through
# fix arbitrary order for displaying buildables on webpage — seems like maybe it's pulling by last_updated?
# ^ok maybe fixed this






### nice to have —————————————————————————————————————
# fix taxes so you can't get money from non active-jobs
# show fun & health in top bar
# add script to randomly add citizens sometimes
# remove ID number from buildables
# clean db writes out of buildable resets
# consolidate job calculations

# add grocery stores? farmers markets? farms?

# hide resources in codebase

# add general "policy" options that aren't buildings
# (speed limits — increase sprawl, increase health)
# (bike lanes?)

# maybe add global limits for amount of cities… artificial scarcity?
# 1000 possible cities?

# error handling/routing for wrong urls — route back to home

# clean up preload situation across the board

# clean up calculate_ functions to only enum through buildables once?
# i think i can do this by just having different preliminary functions before enumerating through the main buildable list
# and maybe I have to store whether they're enabled or not in that enum

# figure out why moving logs make tax logs not appear?
# figure out why taxer stops sometimes

# function to loan/give other cities money?

# eventually could write calculate functions with Stream instead of Enum to speed up

# probably should move treasury out of details and reserve details just for buildables

# — adjust auth so you can only control your own cities (done on front-end)
#   — might need to do this on the backend with a constraint or something in case haxkorz
#   — (although maybe you just couldn't send to the submit action from console?)

# — adjust signin/session time limit (maybe done with persistent session plugin?)

# The buildable comes from the server, I think, and then the metadata gets calculated on the fly?

# phx.gen.context in terminal to generate different contexts;

# auth context with "user" struct

# "city" context, that belongs to user?
#  - type, atom (forest, ocean, mountain, etc) only one type
#  - title, string. only one title
#  - owner, User struct. belongs to. only one owner
#  - log, of changes, of list?
#  - citizens, of type list of structs Citizen?[]

# "citizen" context, that belongs to city?

# basically, anything that can "have" something else belong to it needs an _id field.
# This is guessed automatically as the foreign key when outlining that stuff

# :rand.uniform() random float between 0 and 1

mix phx.gen.context City Town cities \

# so after running all these, they get migration files in /priv/repo/migrations

# see routes
mix phx.routes

# start the server project
mix phx.server

# run iex for the project
iex -S mix phx.server

# to adjust database:
# first, make an ecto migration
mix ecto.gen.migration _name

# then in /priv/repo/migrations it'll make a file you can edit
mix ecto.migrate
# or
mix ecto.rollback # to undo
# or
mix ecto.reset # to reset the whole db

# to run the seeds:
mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs


# fake user:
# hi@test.com
# barron

OTP stuff

{:ok, mover} = MayorGame.Mover.start_link(10)

ok so in the rumble example, the *client* starts a task. it does it async
maybe that makes sense in this case? but idk

# ok this worked when trying to preload stuff
Repo.all(MayorGame.City.Citizens) |> Repo.preload([:town])

# get stuff from a struct with the key atom:
Map.get(city.details, building_type)


root.html.eex goes on every page
live.html.eex might wrap every live thingy?
